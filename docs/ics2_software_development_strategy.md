# JUST Long-Slit ICS 2.0 Software Development Strategy

```text
Scope: software strategy for JUST Long-Slit ICS 2.0
Status: after Phase 2.9-E exposure-record and observatory-context closeout
```

## Mission

JUST Long-Slit ICS 2.0 is the instrument-control software backbone for the JUST long-slit spectrograph.

It is not only a GUI, and it is not a single hardware driver. Its purpose is to provide stable software contracts for routine instrument operation, diagnostics, simulation-first development, future real-hardware adapters, and eventual observatory/OCS integration.

The long-term observing loop is:

```text
OCS / Operator / Future Script
  -> ObservationRequest / ObservationPlan
  -> ICS validation and readiness
  -> command execution
  -> command feedback
  -> ExposureRecord / DataProduct / Quicklook
  -> audit log and recovery path
```

Current phases should build toward this loop through small, testable contracts.

## Strategic principles

### Simulation first

Every contract should work in simulation before real hardware is required. Simulation is not a toy path; it is the first implementation of the same contract real hardware should later satisfy.

### API first

Operator UI, future scripts, future OCS adapters, and tests should all depend on stable API/domain contracts rather than private frontend behavior.

### Contract first

A feature should first stabilize its domain/API meaning before adding large UI surfaces or hardware-specific implementation.

### Operator-safe UI

Routine pages should show safe, meaningful controls and summaries. Low-level hardware, recovery, and unsafe controls belong in Engineer, Housekeeping, or Diagnostics areas and later require role gating.

### Auditable command lifecycle

High-impact commands must remain traceable through:

```text
request_id
command name
latest_job
status
result summary
error code/message/details
raw diagnostics payload
```

### Adapter-bounded hardware integration

Real hardware must enter through explicit adapter/gateway boundaries. Routine UI must not talk directly to vendor SDKs, buses, PLCs, motion controllers, or telescope-control channels.

## ICS boundary

### ICS owns

ICS should own:

- instrument-control API contracts;
- setup/session context;
- slit, calibration, detector, preset, observation, command-feedback semantics;
- runtime state and exposure state;
- command dispatch, job audit, and error reporting;
- simulator-backed operation;
- operator-console information architecture;
- hardware adapter boundaries;
- future data-product metadata contracts.

### ICS does not own

ICS should not own:

- OCS scheduling;
- telescope pointing/slew/focus/rotator authority;
- dome/weather authority;
- full science reduction;
- complete observatory automation;
- low-level hardware bus control in routine UI;
- fake hardware telemetry;
- optical performance itself.

Optical requirements such as resolution, dispersion, throughput, and wavelength range are instrument constraints. Software can expose, validate, record, and coordinate relevant state, but it cannot create optical performance.

## Layered architecture

Recommended responsibility split:

```text
Domain
  Stable concepts: ObservationRequest, Preview, CommandFeedback,
  ExposureRecord, DataProductRef, ObservatoryContext,
  SetupContext, DetectorConfig, Calibration, Slit.

Kernel
  Runtime, states, guards, jobs, command request/job lifecycle.

Application
  Services and use cases. Orchestrates domain/kernel behavior.

API
  FastAPI schemas and routes. Converts request/response contracts.

UI
  Backend-served operator console. Shows summaries first, raw diagnostics second.

Adapter
  Simulator and future real-hardware boundary.

Driver
  Hardware-specific implementation below the adapter boundary.
```

No layer should compensate for a missing contract by leaking implementation detail upward.

## Current contract baseline

The current baseline after Phase 2.9-E includes:

```text
SetupContext
ObservationRequest
ExposureSpec
ObservationPreviewResult
ReadinessSnapshot
ValidationIssue
ObservationCommandFeedback
ObservationCommandFeedbackResponse
ExposureRecord
FrameRecord
DataProductRef
FitsHeaderSummary
QualityFlag
ObservatoryContext
```

Important split:

```text
/status  -> current state
/preview -> side-effect-free advisory readiness/validation
command  -> auditable command feedback
record   -> exposure lifecycle and data-product reference status
context  -> read-only observatory/OCS/TCS visibility
```

Preview and Arm are intentionally independent. UI preview is advisory. Backend Arm gate is authoritative.

Exposure completion and data-product existence are intentionally separate. Simulator data products are references only until a real writer/pipeline exists.

Observatory context is intentionally read-only. ICS must not gain telescope, dome, weather, or OCS write authority without a formal external contract.

## UI route and runtime strategy

Default routes:

```text
/ui        -> v7.1 operator-console prototype
/ui/v7     -> v7.1 explicit prototype
/ui/v5     -> v5 fallback shell
/ui/legacy -> v5 fallback alias
/ui/v6     -> v6 review shell
```

Current runtime policy:

```text
v7 runtime master gate     default on
runtime_status.js          default on
observe_runtime.js         default on
observe_guard.js           default on
setup_runtime.js           default off
instrument_runtime.js      default off
preset_runtime.js          default off
```

Reasoning:

- Observe is now part of the active command-feedback workflow.
- Status runtime is needed for operator context.
- Observe guard is a UI guard, not a backend safety authority.
- Setup/Instrument/Presets runtimes should stay explicit until their runtime behavior is equally mature.

HTML owns durable structure. Runtime JavaScript enhances existing skeletons and should not create duplicate competing panels except as a fallback when a skeleton is missing.

## Roadmap

### Completed contract-hardening baseline

```text
Phase 2.9-A  Setup/Data Context
Phase 2.9-B  Observation Request / Preview / Arm Gate
Phase 2.9-C  Observation Command Feedback + v7 Observe feedback UI
Phase 2.9-D  ExposureRecord / DataProductRef contract
Phase 2.9-E  Read-only ObservatoryContext
```

### Candidate next phases

#### Phase 2.9-F: Operator Workflow Polish

Goal: improve operator comprehension without expanding hardware authority.

Candidate work:

```text
Preset diff polish
Diagnostics command/error polish
Observe feedback and exposure-record wording
Housekeeping/Engineer responsibility split
```

#### Phase 3.0: Observation Plan / Sequence Contract

Goal: introduce multi-exposure observing intent after record semantics are stable.

Candidate concepts:

```text
ObservationPlan
SequencePreview
PlanExecutionState
pause/abort/recover semantics
```

### Later phases

```text
Phase 3.x  Simulator-backed end-to-end observing workflow
Phase 4.x  Real-hardware commissioning through adapter contracts
```

Do not start a multi-exposure sequence runner before the current ExposureRecord/DataProductRef contract is accepted as the baseline.

## Technology adoption gate

A new database, event system, hardware bus, fieldbus, external platform, protocol, or large framework must answer:

```text
1. What current project problem does it solve?
2. Is that problem present in the current phase?
3. Is there real hardware, real operations, or a real interface contract behind it?
4. Can a simpler schema, simulator, file contract, or adapter boundary solve it for now?
5. Does it preserve Domain / Kernel / Application / Adapter boundaries?
6. Does it keep low-level engineering complexity out of routine operator UI?
7. Can it be covered by pytest, integration tests, or hardware-in-loop tests?
8. If we do not adopt it now, can the current phase still move forward cleanly?
```

If these questions cannot be answered, keep the item as:

```text
TBD
candidate
adapter-bounded
future integration
```

Do not promote it into the main roadmap.

## Hardware reality constraints

Current software design must respect these facts:

- JUST long-slit is a B/G/R three-channel spectrograph, not a Blue/Red two-channel instrument.
- Slit width must preserve both operator angular units and backend mechanical units.
- Current slit conversion: `1 arcsec = 128.34 um`.
- Calibration involves mode/path/source/lamp/frame-type compatibility, not only lamp on/off.
- Slit monitor / guider should remain a first-class visible concept.
- TCS context is part of readiness, but early integration should be read-only.
- Real hardware protocol choices are not yet software-roadmap commitments.
- Bottom-layer integration remains hardware-selection-driven.

## Documentation policy

Repository documentation should remain few and durable.

Current durable documents:

```text
README.md
docs/project_status.md
docs/ics2_software_development_strategy.md
docs/operator_console_requirements.md
```

Maintenance rules:

```text
README.md
  Only current repository facts. Do not write implementation history.

docs/project_status.md
  Rewrite the current snapshot at phase boundaries. Do not append project history.

docs/ics2_software_development_strategy.md
  Update only when strategy, architecture, roadmap, or documentation policy changes.

docs/operator_console_requirements.md
  Update only when UI responsibility boundaries, capability classification, or hardware facts change.
```

Do not add one-off phase notes unless there is a clear reason they cannot be folded into one of the durable documents.

A good markdown document should help the next developer decide what to do now. If it mainly explains how the project arrived here, it probably belongs in git history, not in the current document set.

## Success criteria

Short term:

- full test suite remains green;
- current UI/API behavior matches documentation;
- C-stage command feedback remains stable;
- next phase starts from a narrow contract boundary.

Medium term:

- ExposureRecord/DataProductRef semantics become durable;
- simulator-backed end-to-end observing flow becomes repeatable;
- read-only observatory/TCS context becomes honest and useful;
- operator workflow becomes clearer without exposing engineering complexity.

Long term:

- OCS can submit observing intent and read results;
- real hardware integrates through adapter contracts;
- failures, blocked operations, aborts, discards, and recovery steps remain auditable;
- operators can distinguish real, simulated, unavailable, stale, and future capabilities.
